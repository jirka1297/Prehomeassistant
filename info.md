# PRE Distribuce

This integration provides sensors informing about low/high energy tariff (HDO), specifically for Czech PRE Distribuce. Technically it scrapes data from https://www.predistribuce.cz/cs/potrebuji-zaridit/zakaznici/stav-hdo/.

This sensor shows:
- current state of HDO
- time to reach low tariff or time needed to wait for low tarrif

optionally also
-  if a an appliance (e.g. washing machine) can be run at the moment to finish operation within low tariff window (time is configurable)
